# kandev-plugin-redmine

A [kandev](https://github.com/kdlbs/kandev) **native-UI plugin** connecting a
Redmine instance to kandev: link tasks to Redmine issues, sync status both
ways, and watch for new issues. Bootstrapped from
[`kandev-plugin-template`](https://github.com/kdlbs/kandev-plugin-template);
see [`docs/specs/redmine-plugin/spec.md`](https://github.com/kdlbs/kandev/blob/main/docs/specs/redmine-plugin/spec.md)
and [`docs/plans/redmine-plugin/plan.md`](https://github.com/kdlbs/kandev/blob/main/docs/plans/redmine-plugin/plan.md)
in `kdlbs/kandev` for the full design and task breakdown.

- **Connection** — API-key auth (`X-Redmine-API-Key`) only, one connection per
  kandev workspace, validated against `GET /users/current.json`. The key is
  encrypted with workspace-derived key material and stored under a
  plugin-composed secret key (`redmine:<workspace_id>:api_key`), since the
  host's `GetSecret`/`SetSecret` RPCs are namespaced only by plugin ID, not by
  workspace.
- **Own health polling** — no host `healthpoll` equivalent exists for plugins;
  this plugin runs its own ~90s jittered probe per connected workspace.
- **Project and field mapping** — statuses, trackers, and priorities are always
  fetched live from the instance and mapped to kandev workflow steps, labels,
  and priorities; nothing is hardcoded.
- **Issue read/write** — always sends `status_id=*` (Redmine defaults to
  open-only), with attachments via the two-step upload-token flow.
- **Task linking** — `registerTaskAction({placement:"link"})` +
  `host.openTaskLinkDialog`, the same shared native Link surface GitHub/
  Bitbucket use.
- **Bidirectional sync** — cursor-based polling with opt-in outbound
  write-back (`autoStatusWriteback`, `syncTitleDescription`) and echo
  suppression so a write-back round trip never bounces the task.
- **Composer `#` mentions** — resolves Redmine issues through
  `reference_sources` with submit-time reauthorization.
- **Issue watchers** — one kandev task per newly matching issue, deduplicated
  and throttled per watch (`maxInflightTasks`), cascade-deleted via
  `PluginOwnedTaskTrees` when the watch or connection is removed.
- **Settings UI** — `registerIntegrationSettings` contributes a native
  connection form, project picker, field-mapping table, sync-option toggles,
  and watcher management, rendered inside the kandev SPA (not an iframe).

## Use the host's React — and the host's recharts

`initialize(registry, host)` hands you `host.React` (and `host.jsx`, an alias
for `host.React.createElement`). Use it. **Never import or bundle your own
React**: a second React instance has its own hook dispatcher and context
registry, so host components rendered inside your tree lose their providers,
refs break, and `asChild` stops composing.

The same hazard applies to **recharts**: use the `host.ui.Chart*` wrappers
instead of installing your own copy, for the same reason — a second instance
splits the React context recharts' tooltips and legends resolve through.

`host.ui` is broad — `Accordion*`, `Collapsible*`, `Select*`, `Tabs*`,
`Sheet*`, `Pagination*`, `ScrollArea`, `Skeleton`, `Switch`, `Spinner`,
`TooltipProvider`, plus kandev's own `PageTopbar`, `Combobox` and
`TaskCreateDialog`. Check it before hand-rolling a component. The
authoritative list is `PLUGIN_UI` in `apps/web/lib/plugins/host-api.ts` in
`kdlbs/kandev`.

## Actions vs. webhooks

This plugin's own settings UI calls its Go backend through **`actions:`**
entries in `manifest.yaml` (`host.api.invokeAction` on the frontend,
`pluginsdk.ActionHandler.HandleAction` on the backend) — the host
authenticates and authorizes every call and passes a verified
`VerifiedActionContext` (workspace/task ID) the backend must derive its
`plugin_state`/secret keys from, never a request-body-supplied one. There are
no `webhooks:` entries: Redmine core has no outbound webhooks, so nothing
calls into this plugin from the outside.

## Minimum host version

`manifest.yaml` declares `min_kandev_version: "0.88.0"` — the first release
containing `kdlbs/kandev` PR #2117's generic plugin seams this plugin depends
on (`registerIntegrationSettings`, `registerTaskAction({placement:"link"})`,
`reference_sources`, the `PluginOwnedTaskTrees` RPCs). A release host compares
this against its own version at install time and refuses an older one.

It is **release-only by design**: a host built from a git checkout reports a
git-describe version like `v0.87.1-27-g4705f1fd0`, which isn't a release
version, so the gate is skipped and the install succeeds whatever floor is
declared. A successful sideload onto a dev instance is not evidence the floor
is correct — check it against the kandev history instead
(`git merge-base --is-ancestor <commit> <tag>`).

## How a plugin runs (gRPC subprocess, not HTTP)

kandev spawns the platform-matching binary from `runtime.executables` in
`manifest.yaml` as a subprocess and talks to it over a private gRPC connection
([hashicorp/go-plugin](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-plugin)) — there is no
HTTP listen address, no shared secret, and no manual wiring: `pluginsdk.Serve`
in `server/main.go` owns the entire transport. The base interface has two RPCs
and gives you a `Host` handle back:

```go
type Plugin interface {
    OnEvent(ctx context.Context, e *Event) error
    HandleWebhook(ctx context.Context, req *WebhookRequest) (*WebhookResponse, error)
}
```

`server/plugin.go`'s plugin type embeds `pluginsdk.UnimplementedPlugin` (a
no-op default for both RPCs, plus `Host()`/`SetHost()` accessors). Newer
features are additive optional interfaces this plugin implements as needed:
`pluginsdk.ActionHandler` (settings UI backend calls),
`pluginsdk.EntityReferenceSearcher` + `EntityReferenceAuthorizer` (composer
`#` mentions), and `pluginsdk.PluginOwnedTaskTreeHost` consumption via
`Host.PluginOwnedTaskTrees()` (watcher task cascade delete).

## Developing against the SDK

`pkg/pluginsdk` is not published as its own module yet, so `go.mod` here uses
a local `replace`:

```
replace github.com/kandev/kandev => ../kandev/apps/backend
```

This assumes your plugin repo is checked out as a **sibling** of the `kandev`
monorepo:

```
some-dir/
├── kandev/                   # https://github.com/kdlbs/kandev, Go module at apps/backend/
└── kandev-plugin-redmine/    # this repo
```

Note the module root is `kandev/apps/backend`, not the repo root — `kandev` is
a monorepo and the Go backend (including `pkg/pluginsdk`) lives one level down.
Adjust the `replace` path if your layout differs. Once `pkg/pluginsdk` ships as
a standalone, versioned module, this repo will drop the `replace` and pin a
real version instead.

## Layout

```
manifest.yaml          # plugin manifest — id, capabilities, actions, reference_sources, runtime.executables, ui.bundle
server/
  main.go              # pluginsdk.Serve wiring — no flags, no HTTP, no secrets
  plugin.go            # the redmine plugin type: OnEvent / HandleWebhook / ActionHandler / EntityReferenceSearcher
  plugin_test.go       # tests against a fake Host, no subprocess spawn needed
  <package>/           # connection, projects, fieldmapping, issues, sync, tasklink, watch (per plan task)
ui/
  bundle.js            # hand-written, no-build ES module — the plugin's frontend half
```

`ui/bundle.js` is hand-written, dependency-free ES module JavaScript. There is
no build step: it ships byte-for-byte inside the package tar.gz, and kandev
serves it directly. Edit the file and repackage — nothing else to run.

## Build and test

```sh
make build               # go build -o bin/... ./server/...
make test                # go test ./... -race
make vet                 # go vet ./...
make verify-package-host # validate a host-only tarball and checksums
```

> Note: bare `go build ./server/...` (no `-o`) fails with `build output
> "server" already exists and is a directory` — Go's default output name for a
> lone main package is the last path element ("server"), which collides with
> the `server/` source directory. Always pass `-o`, run `go build .` from
> inside `server/`, or use `make build`. `go vet`/`go test` are unaffected.

## Package it

```sh
make package        # cross-compiles linux/darwin (amd64+arm64) + windows/amd64,
                    # then packs manifest + ui/ + binaries into a versioned .tar.gz

make package-host   # host platform only — faster local iteration
make verify-package # build + validate the five-platform archive
```

Both stage `manifest.yaml` + `ui/` alongside the freshly built
`server/plugin-<goos>-<goarch>[.exe]` binaries, then pack the tree with
kandev's `cmd/plugin-pack`, which computes `checksums.txt` and writes the
tarball.

Note the Makefile runs `plugin-pack` with `cd $(KANDEV_SDK) && go run
./cmd/plugin-pack`, from inside the sibling kandev checkout, rather than as
`go run github.com/kandev/kandev/cmd/plugin-pack` from here. The second
spelling resolves plugin-pack's dependencies against *this* module's `go.sum`,
and plugin-pack reaches much further into the kandev backend than `server/`
does — so those entries are missing and packaging fails with `missing go.sum
entry`. Pulling them in would force this repo's `go.sum` to track every
dependency the kandev backend grows. Building the tool where it lives keeps
`go.sum` scoped to what this plugin actually imports.

## Install it against a running kandev

Either through the UI (**Settings > Plugins > Install plugin**, URL or file
upload), or directly:

```sh
curl -F package=@kandev-plugin-redmine-0.1.0.tar.gz \
  http://localhost:<kandev-port>/api/plugins/install
```

kandev verifies `checksums.txt`, validates the manifest, extracts the package,
spawns the host-matching binary, and — once the go-plugin handshake completes —
marks the plugin active. Sideloaded plugins register **disabled/unverified**;
enable it in **Settings > Plugins** (the `plugins` feature flag must be on).
Reinstalling the same version returns 409 — bump `version` in `manifest.yaml`.

## Publish a release

Pull requests run `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (tidy, format, vet, and test) and
`.github/workflows/build.yml` (host build plus a five-platform package). Push a
tag that matches the manifest version to run `.github/workflows/release.yml`:
it repeats verification, cross-compiles all platforms, packs the tarball, and
creates a GitHub Release with the two assets the kandev
[marketplace](https://github.com/kdlbs/kandev/blob/main/docs/public/plugins-marketplace.md)
install pipeline expects:

- `<id>-<version>.tar.gz` — the plugin package (with its own internal
  `checksums.txt` verified on install), and
- `checksums.txt` — the package's internal file checksums, extracted from the
  tarball for inspection and marketplace tooling.

```sh
# bump VERSION in Makefile + version in manifest.yaml first, then:
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0
```

The workflows check out the kandev monorepo as a sibling so the local Go SDK
path resolves (see "Developing against the SDK"). They pin one source revision
for a reproducible contract; advance that pin deliberately and rerun tests
when adopting a newer SDK.
